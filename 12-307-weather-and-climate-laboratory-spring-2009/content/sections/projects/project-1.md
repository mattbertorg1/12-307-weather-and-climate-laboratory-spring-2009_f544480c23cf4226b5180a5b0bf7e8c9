The purpose of this project is to study, using meteorological observations and laboratory experiments, the relation between the wind field and the mass field in a rotating system. In part I we explore the relationship in laboratory experiments; in part II atmospheric observations of intense cyclones and hurricanes are used.

\- Detailed description of the radial inflow tank experiment, together with associated theory. ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/projects/radial_inflow))

\- View recordings of the [Balanced Vortex Experiment](http://paoc.mit.edu/labguide/balmo.html) at the Weather in a Tank Web site

\- Look at the following experiment on [Ekman Layers](http://paoc.mit.edu/labguide/ekman.html) to visualize the impact of surface friction on the balance of forces.

Atmospheric Data
----------------

### Hurricane Case Studies

Hurricane Katrina (Aug'05): [NASA-EO](http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/view.php?id=15399
), [NCDC](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/tropical-cyclones/200508)  
Super-typhoon Ioke (Sept'06): [NASA-EO](http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=6914
), [QuickScat](http://cersat.ifremer.fr/data/products/cal-val/quikscat/quickscat-winds)  
Hurricane Dean (Aug 07): [NCDC](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/tropical-cyclones/200708), [NASA-EO](http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/view.php?id=18889
), [QuickScat](http://cersat.ifremer.fr/data/products/cal-val/quikscat/quickscat-winds)  
Hurricane Bertha (Jul 08): [NASA-EO](http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/view.php?id=20209
)

Surface winds from scatterometer imagery

Choose an hurricane case from the [Scatterometer Imagery of Historical Storms](http://www.remss.com/) and:  
1\. Plot the surface winds at different times along the path of the hurricane.  
2\. Choose a specific time and download the wind data to compute the Rossby number in function of radius - [See Instructions](http://weatherclimatelab.mit.edu/scatterometer-instructions)  
3\. Discuss how the hurricane data compare to the radial inflow experiment.

### Upper Air Analyses and Geostrophic/ageostrophic Flow

Read here for notes on geostrophic balance and on hydrostatic balance. ([PDF 1]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/projects/gostrophic_blnce)) ([PDF 2]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/projects/hydrostatic))

**Planetary scale:** Use [Scalar and Wind](http://paoc.mit.edu/synoptic/custom/anyscalarwind.asp) to plot the 500 mb height and wind (observed and geostrophic) on the large scale. Discuss the balance of force typical of the large scale atmospheric motion.

**Hurricane scale:** Use [Scalar and Wind](http://paoc.mit.edu/synoptic/custom/anyscalarwind.asp) to plot the 700 mb height and wind in an hurricane case.

Discuss the balance of force typical of the hurricane scale: geostrophic, cyclostrophic and gradient wind balance.

**Note**

[GDPLOT](http://paoc.mit.edu/synoptic/custom/gdplot.asp) should be used to plot the height and wind from a regional analysis over the US.

Use [GDPLOT\_surf](http://paoc.mit.edu/synoptic/custom/gdplot_surf.asp) to plot the surface analyzed wind and pressure.

Use [Surface Pressure and Wind](http://paoc.mit.edu/synoptic/custom/surfacepress.asp) to plot surface station winds and pressure. Discuss the balance of forces typical of the surface flow.
